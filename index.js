        console.log('Component mounted, router is ready');
        // You can use router methods here, e.g., router.push('/some-path')
        // Example: Navigate to a different path
        // router.push('/some-path');
        // This will redirect the user to '/some-path' when the component mounts
        // You can also use router.replace('/some-path') to replace the current history entry
        // or router.back() to go back to the previous page
        // Note: Ensure that you handle any potential side effects or cleanup if necessary
        // For example, if you want to navigate to a specific path after some condition is met
        // or after fetching data, you can do that here.
        // This is just an example, and you can customize it based on your application's logic
        // For instance, you might want to fetch some data and then navigate based on that data
        // or perform some other actions before navigating.
        // Remember to handle any potential errors or edge cases when using the router methods
        // For example, if the path you are trying to navigate to does not exist,
        // you might want to show an error message or redirect to a fallback page.
        // This is a simple example to demonstrate the use of useRouter in a React component
        // You can expand this logic based on your application's requirements
        // and the specific use case you have in mind.
        // If you want to navigate to a specific path after some condition is met,
        // you can do that here as well.
        // For example, if you want to navigate to a different page after fetching data,
        // you can use the router methods to achieve that.
        // This is just a basic example to illustrate the use of useRouter in a React component
        // You can customize it further based on your application's needs.
